# Targeted Restoration Plan

Status: No restorations required based on code-first verification.

If follow-ups are desired, optional polish items (non-blocking):
- Add a small date utility to centralize ISO formatting (consistency helper), though current usage is already safe.
- Add a lightweight async helper for `allSettled` result parsing (pattern already present in `openshift-client-enhanced.ts`).
