    "IngressControllerDegraded",
    "TektonResultsStorageFailure",
    "MachineSetScaleDown",
    "ClusterOperatorDegraded"
  ],
  "rootCause": "Infrastructure scale-down in eu-west-1a and eu-west-1b zones caused zone affinity conflicts for storage provisioning, preventing PostgreSQL database from scheduling. This cascaded to ingress router deployment issues and operator degradation.",
  "resolution": "Identified that MachineSets in eu-west-1a and eu-west-1b zones were scaled to 0 machines, while only eu-west-1c had active worker nodes. This caused zone mismatch where PV required eu-west-1a but no nodes were available in that zone. The root cause was infrastructure scale-down rather than resource exhaustion or application-level scale-down.",
