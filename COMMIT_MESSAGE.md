docs: Remove production hype, reflect accurate beta status and architectural foundation

## Major README Overhaul - Honest Beta Status

### Removed Production Marketing Hype
- Remove "Production Ready" claims - replaced with "Beta Software with Rapid Evolution" 
- Remove unsubstantiated "90%+ Tool Success Rate" metrics
- Remove inflated "13 Operational Tools Available" count
- Add clear limitations and known issues sections

### Emphasize Architectural Foundation Achievement
- Highlight 22 comprehensive ADRs as primary accomplishment
- Show systematic development approach over feature count claims
- Add architectural health metrics: 53% implemented, 29% production-ready
- Feature epic roadmap with clear dependencies (F-001→F-003→F-006→F-008→F-009→F-002)

### Accurate Implementation Status
- Core systems table showing what's actually production ready (5 components)
- Beta features table with honest implementation percentages
- Designed-but-not-implemented section with realistic timeframes
- Tool maturity levels (Alpha/Beta/Production) with current reality assessment

### Beta-Appropriate Messaging Strategy
- "Systematic AI-Powered Framework" vs "Production Ready Platform"
- Clear API stability warnings and performance limitations
- Appropriate support expectations for beta software
- "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast" development principle emphasized

### Documentation Links and Timeline Fixes  
- Remove calendar-based roadmap phases (Q4 2024, Q1 2025, Q2 2025)
- Phase-based roadmap suitable for AI-human sprint timelines
- Fix documentation template references to existing files
- Verify all linked paths exist and are accurate

### Context: Post-Architecture Foundation Work
This update follows completion of comprehensive architectural documentation:
- 89% ADR coverage with systematic gap remediation
- 9 feature epics with dependency-driven implementation framework  
- Validated systematic development process using bounded AI integration
- Need for realistic user expectations vs overstated capability claims

### Impact
- Repository visitors get accurate expectations for beta software
- Architectural foundation work properly highlighted as primary achievement
- Clear contribution guidelines for beta testing program
- Realistic roadmap phases without artificial calendar commitments

Aligns with systematic architectural development approach and "deliberate accuracy over marketing hype" principle.
