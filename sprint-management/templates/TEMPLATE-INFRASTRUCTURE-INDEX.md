# Template Infrastructure Index - Process v3.3 Enhanced
**Infrastructure Status**: Consolidated (2025-09-06)  
**Current Framework**: Process v3.3.1-enhanced with Aviation Safety Integration  
**Template Version Control**: Explicit versioning implemented with evolution tracking

---

## CURRENT TEMPLATE INFRASTRUCTURE

### Active Templates (current/)
All templates in `current/` directory are **Process v3.3.1-enhanced** with explicit version headers:

**Role Context Templates:**
- `role-context-developer.md` - Problem-resolution framework with evidence standards
- `role-context-tester.md` - Evidence validation with completeness scoring  
- `role-context-reviewer.md` - Resolution verification with landing protocol

**Framework Templates:**
- `SPRINT-LANDING-CHECKLIST-V3.3-ENHANCED.md` - Aviation safety protocol for sprint closure

### Template Version Headers (Standardized)
Every current template includes explicit version tracking:
```markdown
**Template Version**: v3.3.1-enhanced (2025-09-06)  
**Process Framework**: Process v3.3 Enhanced with Aviation Safety Integration  
**Template Type**: Current/Active - [Framework Type]  
**Supersedes**: v3.3.0, v3.2.x, v3.1.x (archived to legacy/)
```

---

## LEGACY TEMPLATE ARCHIVE

### Archived Templates (legacy/)
All superseded templates moved to `legacy/` with deprecation documentation:

**v3.3.0 Templates (archived):**
- `role-context-developer-v3.3-template.md` - Original problem-resolution paradigm
- `role-context-tester-v3.3-template.md` - Original evidence validation framework
- `role-context-reviewer-v3.3-template.md` - Original resolution verification

**v3.2.x and Earlier Templates (archived):**
- `role-context-developer-template.md` - Task-completion framework
- `role-context-tester-template.md` - Feature validation framework  
- `role-context-reviewer-template.md` - Quality assessment framework

## TEMPLATE USAGE GUIDELINES

### Current Template Selection
**For All Process v3.3 Enhanced Sprints:**
- Use **only** templates from `current/` directory
- Verify template version header shows `v3.3.1-enhanced`
- Ensure aviation safety protocol compatibility
- Follow landing checklist requirements

### Legacy Template Reference
**Historical Context Only:**
- `legacy/` templates preserved for organizational learning
- No longer suitable for operational use
- Reference for evolution analysis and improvement insights
- Comparison baseline for framework effectiveness assessment

### Template Customization
**Permitted Modifications:**
- Sprint-specific problem categories and domains
- Evidence requirements based on sprint complexity
- Quality standards appropriate to sprint scope
- Archive requirements consistent with landing protocol

**Prohibited Modifications:**
- Version headers or framework compatibility statements
- Core Process v3.3 Enhanced methodology
- Aviation safety protocol requirements
- Evidence completeness standards (≥ 0.9)

## INFRASTRUCTURE CRISIS RESOLUTION

### Emergency Consolidation Results
**Pre-Consolidation State:**
- Multiple role template versions scattered across single directory
- No clear indication of current vs deprecated templates
- Framework fragmentation threatening operational integrity
- Version evolution tracking absent from template documentation

**Post-Consolidation State:**
- Clear current/ vs legacy/ directory separation
- Explicit version headers in all templates
- Aviation safety integration across active templates
- Systematic evolution tracking with deprecation documentation

### Prevention Measures Implemented
**Template Version Control:**
- Explicit version headers prevent operational confusion
- Clear supersession documentation in all current templates
- Systematic evolution history tracking
- Framework compatibility statements for integration verification

**Organizational Discipline:**
- current/ directory contains only operational templates
- legacy/ archive preserves historical context
- Template modification guidelines prevent infrastructure degradation
- Aviation safety protocol ensures systematic closure

---

## TEMPLATE MAINTENANCE PROTOCOLS

### Version Evolution Process
1. **Enhancement Development**: New template versions developed with explicit headers
2. **Framework Testing**: Version compatibility verified through sprint execution
3. **Consolidation**: Previous versions archived to legacy/ with deprecation notes
4. **Documentation**: Evolution history updated with systematic tracking

### Quality Assurance
**Template Integrity:**
- Version headers mandatory for all templates
- Framework compatibility verification required
- Evolution tracking documentation maintained
- Archive integration tested through landing protocol

**Operational Discipline:**
- current/ directory contains only active templates
- Legacy templates clearly marked as deprecated
- Template selection guidelines prevent version confusion
- Framework evolution managed through systematic process

## CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

**Template Infrastructure**: ✅ **CONSOLIDATED AND OPERATIONAL**

**Active Framework**: Process v3.3.1-enhanced with Aviation Safety Integration
**Version Control**: Explicit headers implemented across all templates
**Archive Integration**: Landing protocol compatible templates ready for sprint execution
**Crisis Prevention**: Organizational discipline measures active

The template infrastructure crisis has been systematically resolved through emergency consolidation with explicit version control, clear directory separation, and aviation safety protocol integration. All role context templates are now operationally ready for Process v3.3 Enhanced sprint execution.
