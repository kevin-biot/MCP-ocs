# Aviation Safety Protocol for Sprint Closure

**Sprint ID**: [d-XXX-description-YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Process Framework**: v3.3 Enhanced (Aviation Safety Integration)  
**Landing Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Landing Officer**: [Role executing closure]

---

## PRE-LANDING VERIFICATION

### Artifact Tracking Status
- [ ] **Execution Artifacts**: All role-based logs remain in designated workspace
- [ ] **Ad Hoc Prevention**: No scattered artifacts in review/, testing/, historical-data/
- [ ] **Process Evolution**: Framework changes documented for systematic integration
- [ ] **Archive Plan**: Standardized directory structure verified

### Quality Gate Verification
- [ ] **Problem Resolution**: Core objectives achieved with evidence
- [ ] **Technical Debt**: Zero debt policy maintained throughout sprint
- [ ] **Quality Standards**: All validation gates passed successfully
- [ ] **Evidence Documentation**: Systematic evidence collection complete

---

## LANDING SEQUENCE EXECUTION

### Phase 1: Archive Preparation
- [ ] **Directory Creation**: `d-{id}-{description}-{yyyy-mm-dd}` format created
- [ ] **Artifact Collection**: All execution artifacts moved to archive directory
- [ ] **Evidence Integration**: Comparative evidence analysis completed
- [ ] **Documentation Verification**: Complete audit trail available

### Phase 2: Archive Validation
- [ ] **Mandatory Artifacts (11 Required)**:
  - [ ] formal-closure-index.md
  - [ ] session-report-codex.md  
  - [ ] execution-log-developer.md
  - [ ] execution-log-tester.md
  - [ ] execution-log-reviewer.md
  - [ ] completion-developer-handoff.md
  - [ ] completion-tester-verification.md
  - [ ] completion-final-closure.md
  - [ ] prompt-archive.md
  - [ ] scrum-master-assessment.md
  - [ ] process-evolution-notes.md

### Phase 3: Organizational Hygiene
- [ ] **Workspace Cleanup**: Active directories cleaned of completed artifacts
- [ ] **Registry Update**: Sprint registry updated with archive location
- [ ] **Framework Evolution**: Process artifacts moved to framework-evolution/
- [ ] **Prevention Documentation**: Lessons learned integrated into framework

---

## POST-LANDING VERIFICATION

### Final Safety Checks
- [ ] **Archive Completeness**: All artifacts present and properly organized
- [ ] **Naming Standardization**: Directory follows organizational standard
- [ ] **Consolidation Verification**: No duplicate artifacts in multiple locations
- [ ] **Emergency Prevention**: Aviation protocols validated for next sprint

### Organizational Learning Integration
- [ ] **Evidence Analysis**: Systematic findings documented for future application
- [ ] **Process Calibration**: Estimation and execution lessons captured
- [ ] **Framework Enhancement**: Process improvements integrated systematically
- [ ] **Meta-Process Update**: Landing protocol effectiveness assessed

---

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### If Landing Issues Discovered
1. **Scattered Artifacts**: Execute emergency consolidation to recovery-consolidation/
2. **Missing Artifacts**: Document gaps and reconstruct with available evidence
3. **Framework Evolution**: Process changes moved to systematic integration queue
4. **Quality Concerns**: Address before final closure certification

### Prevention Measures
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor artifact creation during sprint execution
- **Systematic Discipline**: Use aviation protocols to prevent organizational debt
- **Innovation Balance**: Maintain development speed through systematic organization
- **Crisis Preparedness**: Emergency consolidation procedures validated and ready

---

## LANDING CERTIFICATION

### Final Certification Checklist
- [ ] **Technical Completion**: All objectives achieved with quality maintained
- [ ] **Archive Standards**: Complete organizational compliance achieved
- [ ] **Framework Integration**: Process evolution systematically managed
- [ ] **Prevention Implementation**: Aviation safety protocols operational

**LANDING STATUS**: [ ] CLEARED FOR FINAL CLOSURE

**Landing Officer Signature**: ___________________  
**Date**: ___________________  
**Next Sprint Clearance**: [ ] APPROVED with aviation protocols active
