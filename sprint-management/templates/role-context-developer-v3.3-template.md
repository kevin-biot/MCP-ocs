## Problem-Resolution Strategy

### Systematic Elimination Plan
1. **Baseline Scanning**: Identify all instances of [PROBLEM_CATEGORY]
2. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate elimination order and dependencies
3. **Systematic Fixes**: Eliminate problems with consistent patterns
4. **Prevention Implementation**: Add safeguards against recurrence
5. **Evidence Collection**: Document before/after state with metrics

### Quality Intelligence Integration
```bash
# Load domain context with quality intelligence
./scripts/get-sprint-context.sh --domain=[DOMAIN] --include-weekly-findings

# Review specific problem patterns
cat /sprint-management/review-prompt-lib/domains/[DOMAIN]/historical/finding-registry.json

# Check cross-domain implications
./scripts/determine-domains.sh --modified-files
```

### Evidence Requirements (Process v3.3)
- [ ] **Baseline Documentation**: Current state before elimination
- [ ] **Elimination Evidence**: Proof of systematic problem removal
- [ ] **Prevention Validation**: Safeguards working correctly
- [ ] **Completeness Scoring**: Evidence quality ≥ 0.9
- [ ] **Quality Improvement**: Measurable baseline enhancement

## Expected Problem Areas

### Based on Quality Intelligence Analysis:
- **Primary Risk Area**: [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM_HOTSPOT]
- **Secondary Concerns**: [ADDITIONAL_RISK_AREAS]
- **Cross-Domain Impact**: [RELATED_DOMAINS] requiring validation
- **Complexity Factors**: [ELIMINATION_CHALLENGES] to address

### Relevant Quality Domains for Coordination:
- **Primary Domain**: [MAIN_DOMAIN] - direct problem elimination
- **Secondary Domain**: [RELATED_DOMAIN] - prevention integration
- **Pattern Validation**: [DOMAIN_RULES] for systematic consistency

## Success Criteria for Today
- [ ] All [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] instances systematically identified
- [ ] Systematic elimination approach implemented consistently
- [ ] Zero [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] instances remaining in scope
- [ ] Prevention measures implemented and validated
- [ ] Evidence completeness score ≥ 0.9 achieved
- [ ] Quality baseline improvement demonstrated
- [ ] Handoff notes complete for TESTER role validation

## Problem-Resolution Methodology

### Evidence-Based Elimination Framework:
- **Before State**: Document current [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] instances
- **Systematic Approach**: Consistent elimination patterns across codebase
- **After State**: Verify zero instances with comprehensive scanning
- **Prevention**: Implement safeguards against problem recurrence
- **Validation**: Cross-domain testing for regression prevention

### Quality Intelligence Application:
- **Historical Patterns**: Apply lessons from previous elimination efforts
- **Cross-Domain Awareness**: Consider impacts on related quality domains
- **Prevention Focus**: Address root causes, not just symptoms
- **Evidence Standards**: Meet Process v3.3 completeness requirements

## Special Considerations

### For This Problem-Resolution Sprint:
[Any problem-specific considerations]
- **Sprint Goals**: [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] systematic elimination with prevention
- **Quality Debt Focus**: [TECHNICAL_DEBT_CATEGORIES] being addressed
- **Architectural Impact**: [ADR_ALIGNMENT] and pattern consistency
- **Future Prevention**: [SYSTEMIC_IMPROVEMENTS] for long-term quality

### Integration Concerns:
- **Cross-Domain Impact**: How elimination affects [RELATED_DOMAINS]
- **Regression Risk**: Areas requiring careful validation after changes
- **Performance Impact**: Efficiency considerations for elimination approach
- **Testing Requirements**: Domain-specific validation for elimination proof

## Role Chain Context
**Your Input From**: Quality Intelligence (weekly findings) + Human problem prioritization  
**Your Output Feeds**: TESTER role (systematic elimination validation)  
**Evidence Requirements**: Problem elimination proof with ≥ 0.9 completeness score  
**Quality Integration**: Feeds back to weekly Review-Prompt-Lib process

## Problem-Resolution Escalation Criteria
- **Scope Expansion**: When [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] reveals deeper systemic issues
- **Cross-Domain Conflicts**: Elimination approach affects multiple domains
- **Evidence Gaps**: Cannot achieve ≥ 0.9 completeness threshold
- **Prevention Complexity**: Safeguards require architectural changes

## Process v3.3 Integration Notes

### Quality Intelligence Workflow:
1. Weekly Review-Prompt-Lib findings identify problem categories
2. Daily problem-resolution sprints systematically eliminate identified issues
3. Evidence and improvements feed back to weekly quality intelligence

### Evidence-Based Approach:
- Focus on systematic elimination with measurable proof
- Require prevention measures, not just quick fixes
- Maintain evidence completeness standards throughout
- Integrate improvements into quality baseline for future sprints
