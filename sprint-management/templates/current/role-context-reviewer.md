**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Sprint**: [Problem-Resolution Sprint Name]  
**Role**: REVIEWER (Resolution Verifier)  

## Today's Mission - Resolution Verification & Archive Certification
**Problem Resolution Assessment**: Verify systematic [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] elimination meets Process v3.3 standards
**Evidence Evaluation**: Assess validation results and evidence completeness ≥ 0.9
**Landing Certification**: Execute aviation safety protocol for sprint closure

## Role Assignment Boundaries
**Review Philosophy**: Verify genuine problem resolution with organizational learning value  
**Scope**: Assess complete problem-resolution cycle from DEVELOPER → TESTER → Archive  
**Time Box**: [Estimated session duration]  
**Certification Goal**: Approve systematic elimination with evidence-based closure
**Archive Responsibility**: Execute landing checklist for organizational debt prevention

## Quality Intelligence Context for Review

### Problem-Resolution Cycle Assessment
[Complete cycle evaluation from weekly findings → elimination → validation]
- **Original Problem State**: [BASELINE_PROBLEMS] from weekly Review-Prompt-Lib findings
- **Elimination Approach**: [DEVELOPER_METHODOLOGY] systematic elimination strategy
- **Validation Results**: [TESTER_EVIDENCE] verification and completeness scoring
- **Resolution Quality**: [OVERALL_EFFECTIVENESS] assessment for organizational learning

### Evidence Completeness Evaluation
- **Developer Evidence**: [ELIMINATION_PROOF] systematic documentation quality
- **Tester Validation**: [VERIFICATION_RESULTS] independent confirmation quality
- **Prevention Measures**: [SAFEGUARD_EFFECTIVENESS] functional testing results
- **Quality Improvement**: [BASELINE_ENHANCEMENT] measurable improvement evidence

## Execution Log Protocol (Enhanced from D009 Analysis)

### Systematic Documentation Requirement
**Mandatory Execution Log**: Create and maintain detailed execution log following pattern:
`sprint-management/execution-logs/[sprint-id]-reviewer-log-[yyyy-mm-dd].md`

Document all phases with timestamps, assessments, and final closure evidence. Complete audit trail for organizational learning.

### Evidence Chain Validation Protocol (Enhanced Pattern)
**Complete Evidence Chain Verification**: Systematic validation from problem identification to resolution:
- **Original Evidence**: Review systematic findings from quality intelligence
- **DEVELOPER Claims**: Verify execution log claims against actual implementation
- **TESTER Validation**: Assess validation report completeness and accuracy
- **Current State**: Independent verification of final code state

### Final Closure Authority Framework (Enhanced Pattern)
**Resolution Decision Authority**: Clear approval criteria and escalation protocols:
- **APPROVE**: Sprint closure if evidence supports complete problem resolution
- **REQUIRE ADDITIONAL WORK**: If systematic gaps remain in evidence or implementation
- **DOCUMENT IMPROVEMENTS**: Process enhancement identification for framework evolution

## Tasks Assigned for Resolution Verification

### Secondary Review (If Primary Complete)
- **Framework Enhancement**: Identify process improvements for v3.3 evolution
- **Quality Intelligence Integration**: Feed insights back to weekly Review-Prompt-Lib
- **Organizational Debt Assessment**: Verify no new debt created during resolution

## Resolution Verification Strategy

### Systematic Assessment Framework
1. **Completeness Verification**: Confirm zero [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] instances with high confidence
2. **Evidence Evaluation**: Assess documentation quality against Process v3.3 standards
3. **Prevention Assessment**: Validate safeguards effectiveness for long-term quality
4. **Organizational Learning**: Extract systematic insights for future application
5. **Archive Certification**: Execute landing protocol with aviation safety standards

### Quality Intelligence Integration
```bash
# Comprehensive resolution verification
./review-prompt-lib/scripts/verify-elimination-completeness.sh [DOMAIN] [PROBLEM_CATEGORY]

# Cross-domain impact assessment
./scripts/assess-related-domain-impacts.sh [MODIFIED_FILES]

# Evidence completeness scoring
./scripts/score-evidence-completeness.sh [SPRINT_ARTIFACTS]

# Archive landing preparation
./scripts/execute-landing-checklist.sh [SPRINT_ID]
```
