## 🚨 CRITICAL SCRUM MASTER PROTOCOL

### **TEMPLATE REFERENCE VERIFICATION FOR CLAUDE**
As the Scrum Master role, Claude must ensure systematic template reference in all outputs:

```
SCRUM MASTER VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Correct template version referenced (v3.3.1-enhanced)
- [ ] Role-specific template loaded and applied
- [ ] Aviation safety protocol integration verified
- [ ] All mandatory reference files accessible
- [ ] Landing protocol preparation included
- [ ] Evidence standards ≥ 0.9 maintained
- [ ] Cross-domain awareness documented
- [ ] Archive preparation systematic
```

### **PROMPT GENERATION PROTOCOL FOR CLAUDE**
When Claude generates prompts, MUST include:

1. **Template Version Verification**: Explicit v3.3.1-enhanced reference
2. **Role Context Integration**: Appropriate role template content embedded
3. **Aviation Safety Requirements**: Landing protocol compatibility
4. **Reference File Protocol**: Complete file paths for Codex context
5. **Evidence Standards**: Process v3.3 completeness requirements
6. **Archive Integration**: Systematic closure preparation
