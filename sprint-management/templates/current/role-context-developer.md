**Template Type**: Current/Active - Problem-Resolution Framework  
**Supersedes**: v3.3.0, v3.2.x, v3.1.x (archived to legacy/)

## Guardrails
See: `sprint-management/templates/current/guardrails/ROLE_GUARDRAILS_V3.3.1.md` (Developer section)

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Sprint**: [Problem-Resolution Sprint Name]  
**Role**: DEVELOPER (Problem Solver)  

## Today's Mission - Problem Elimination Focus
**Problem Category**: [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] systematic elimination in [DOMAIN]
**Quality Intelligence**: [WEEKLY_FINDINGS_COUNT] findings inform systematic approach
**Evidence Standard**: Achieve ≥ 0.9 completeness score with comprehensive elimination proof

## Role Assignment Boundaries
**Problem Philosophy**: Eliminate quality debt systematically, not just complete tasks  
**Scope**: Systematically eliminate [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] across identified files/components  
**Time Box**: [Estimated session duration]  
**Evidence Goal**: Zero [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] instances + prevention measures implemented
**Archive Integration**: All artifacts must support systematic landing protocol

## Quality Intelligence Context

### Weekly Findings Summary
[Key points from Review-Prompt-Lib weekly findings]
- **Domain Status**: [DOMAIN] current quality baseline
- **Historical Patterns**: [PATTERN_SUMMARY] in this problem category
- **Cross-Domain Impact**: [RELATED_DOMAINS] may be affected
- **Previous Elimination Attempts**: [LESSONS_LEARNED] from past efforts

### Problem Baseline Assessment
- **Current State**: [BASELINE_METRICS] before elimination
- **Scope Definition**: [PROBLEM_BOUNDARIES] for systematic approach
- **Success Criteria**: [SPECIFIC_ELIMINATION_GOALS] with evidence requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: [POTENTIAL_COMPLICATIONS] to monitor

## Execution Log Protocol (Enhanced from D009 Analysis)

### Systematic Documentation Requirement
**Mandatory Execution Log**: Create and maintain detailed execution log following pattern:
`sprint-management/execution-logs/[sprint-id]-developer-log-[yyyy-mm-dd].md`

Document all phases with timestamps, findings, and evidence. Maintain consistency with TESTER and REVIEWER logging patterns for complete audit trail.

## Problems Assigned for Elimination

### Primary Problem-Resolution Tasks
- **PROBLEM-001**: [Specific problem instance from quality intelligence]
  - **Priority**: HIGH (P0/P1 from weekly findings)
  - **Elimination Approach**: [SYSTEMATIC_METHOD]
  - **Evidence Requirements**: [BEFORE_AFTER_METRICS]
  - **Files Affected**: [SPECIFIC_FILES] identified from scanning
  - **Prevention Measures**: [SAFEGUARDS] to implement

- **PROBLEM-002**: [Second problem instance if applicable]
  - **Priority**: MEDIUM 
  - **Elimination Scope**: [BOUNDED_APPROACH]
  - **Integration Impact**: [RELATED_COMPONENTS]

### Secondary Problem Areas (If Primary Complete)
- **Pattern Analysis**: Identify systemic causes of [PROBLEM_CATEGORY]
- **Prevention Framework**: Implement safeguards against recurrence
- **Cross-Domain Validation**: Ensure no regression in related domains

## Problem-Resolution Strategy

### Systematic Elimination Plan
1. **Baseline Scanning**: Identify all instances of [PROBLEM_CATEGORY]
2. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate elimination order and dependencies
3. **Systematic Fixes**: Eliminate problems with consistent patterns
4. **Prevention Implementation**: Add safeguards against recurrence
5. **Evidence Collection**: Document before/after state with metrics

### Quality Intelligence Integration
```bash
# Load domain context with quality intelligence
./scripts/get-sprint-context.sh --domain=[DOMAIN] --include-weekly-findings

# Review specific problem patterns
cat /sprint-management/review-prompt-lib/domains/[DOMAIN]/historical/finding-registry.json

# Check cross-domain implications
./scripts/determine-domains.sh --modified-files
```

### Evidence Requirements (Process v3.3 Enhanced)
- [ ] **Baseline Documentation**: Current state before elimination
- [ ] **Elimination Evidence**: Proof of systematic problem removal
- [ ] **Prevention Validation**: Safeguards working correctly
- [ ] **Completeness Scoring**: Evidence quality ≥ 0.9
- [ ] **Quality Improvement**: Measurable baseline enhancement
- [ ] **Archive Preparation**: All artifacts ready for landing protocol

## Success Criteria for Today
- [ ] **Execution Log**: Systematic documentation completed with timestamps and evidence
- [ ] All [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] instances systematically identified
- [ ] Systematic elimination approach implemented consistently
- [ ] Zero [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] instances remaining in scope
- [ ] Prevention measures implemented and validated
- [ ] Evidence completeness score ≥ 0.9 achieved
- [ ] Quality baseline improvement demonstrated
- [ ] **Before/After Evidence**: Complete systematic proof of elimination documented
- [ ] Handoff notes complete for TESTER role validation
- [ ] Archive artifacts prepared for landing checklist

## Problem-Resolution Methodology

### Evidence-Based Elimination Framework:
- **Before State**: Document current [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] instances
- **Systematic Approach**: Consistent elimination patterns across codebase
- **After State**: Verify zero instances with comprehensive scanning
- **Prevention**: Implement safeguards against problem recurrence
- **Validation**: Cross-domain testing for regression prevention

### Aviation Safety Integration (v3.3 Enhanced):
- **Landing Preparation**: All artifacts organized for systematic closure
- **Quality Documentation**: Evidence prepared for archive validation
- **Prevention Integration**: Safeguards compatible with landing protocol

## Role Chain Context
**Your Input From**: Quality Intelligence (weekly findings) + Human problem prioritization  
**Your Output Feeds**: TESTER role (systematic elimination validation)  
**Evidence Requirements**: Problem elimination proof with ≥ 0.9 completeness score  
**Archive Integration**: All outputs must support aviation safety landing protocol

## Problem-Resolution Escalation Criteria
- **Scope Expansion**: When [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] reveals deeper systemic issues
- **Cross-Domain Conflicts**: Elimination approach affects multiple domains
- **Evidence Gaps**: Cannot achieve ≥ 0.9 completeness threshold
- **Prevention Complexity**: Safeguards require architectural changes
