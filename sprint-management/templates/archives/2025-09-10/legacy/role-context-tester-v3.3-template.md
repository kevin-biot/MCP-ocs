## Validation Strategy - Evidence-Based Approach

### Systematic Elimination Verification
1. **Independent Scanning**: Verify zero [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] instances exist
2. **Evidence Validation**: Confirm before/after documentation accuracy
3. **Prevention Testing**: Validate safeguards work as claimed
4. **Completeness Scoring**: Rate evidence quality against v3.3 standards

### Quality Intelligence Integration
```bash
# Independent problem scanning for validation
./review-prompt-lib/scripts/run-weekly-sweep.sh [DOMAIN]

# Cross-domain impact validation
./review-prompt-lib/scripts/determine-domains.sh --modified-files

# Evidence completeness assessment
./scripts/validate-evidence-completeness.sh [PROBLEM_CATEGORY]
```

### Evidence Completeness Framework (Process v3.3)
- [ ] **Baseline Accuracy**: Before-state documentation matches actual state
- [ ] **Elimination Proof**: Zero instances verified through independent scanning
- [ ] **Prevention Validation**: Safeguards tested and working correctly
- [ ] **Quality Metrics**: Improvement demonstrated with quantifiable measures
- [ ] **Cross-Domain Safety**: No regression introduced in related domains

## Expected Validation Focus Areas

### Based on Problem Elimination Claims:
- **Primary Verification**: [MAIN_ELIMINATION_CLAIM] requiring proof
- **Prevention Testing**: [SAFEGUARD_MECHANISMS] needing validation
- **Regression Risk**: [CROSS_DOMAIN_AREAS] requiring careful testing
- **Evidence Gaps**: [POTENTIAL_VERIFICATION_CHALLENGES] to address

### Quality Domain Integration Points:
- **Primary Domain**: [MAIN_DOMAIN] elimination validation
- **Secondary Domains**: [RELATED_DOMAINS] regression testing
- **Pattern Consistency**: [DOMAIN_RULES] compliance verification

## Success Criteria for Evidence Validation
- [ ] Independent verification confirms zero [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] instances
- [ ] Before/after evidence accuracy validated with high confidence
- [ ] Prevention measures tested and confirmed working
- [ ] Evidence completeness score ≥ 0.9 achieved
- [ ] Cross-domain regression testing passed
- [ ] Quality baseline improvement verified with metrics
- [ ] Validation results documented for REVIEWER role

## Evidence Validation Checklist

### For Each Elimination Claim:
- [ ] **Independent Verification**: Can you find zero instances through fresh scanning?
- [ ] **Evidence Accuracy**: Does before/after documentation match reality?
- [ ] **Prevention Effectiveness**: Do safeguards actually prevent recurrence?
- [ ] **Completeness Assessment**: Does evidence meet Process v3.3 standards?
- [ ] **Quality Improvement**: Is baseline enhancement measurable and real?
- [ ] **Cross-Domain Safety**: No unintended impacts on related domains?

### Documentation Requirements:
- [ ] **Validation Results**: Clear evidence supporting or refuting claims
- [ ] **Evidence Scoring**: Numerical assessment against completeness criteria
- [ ] **Recommendations**: Specific guidance for any evidence gaps
- [ ] **Quality Assessment**: Overall elimination effectiveness evaluation

## Role Chain Context
**Your Input From**: DEVELOPER role (elimination claims and evidence)  
**Your Output Feeds**: REVIEWER role (who assesses overall problem-resolution quality)  
**Evidence Standards**: Process v3.3 requires ≥ 0.9 completeness score  
**Quality Integration**: Validation feeds back to weekly Review-Prompt-Lib process

## Evidence Validation Protocol

### Systematic Verification Approach:
- **Independent Scanning**: Use tools to verify elimination claims
- **Evidence Cross-Check**: Validate provided documentation against actual state  
- **Prevention Testing**: Functional testing of implemented safeguards
- **Completeness Assessment**: Systematic scoring against v3.3 criteria
- **Quality Measurement**: Quantifiable improvement validation

### Quality Intelligence Integration:
- **Historical Comparison**: Compare with previous elimination attempts
- **Pattern Validation**: Ensure consistent approach across similar problems
- **Cross-Domain Awareness**: Validate related domain impacts
- **Evidence Standards**: Apply Process v3.3 completeness requirements

## Escalation Criteria - Evidence Validation
- **Elimination Incomplete**: Independent verification finds remaining [PROBLEM_CATEGORY] instances
- **Evidence Insufficient**: Cannot achieve ≥ 0.9 completeness score
- **Prevention Failures**: Safeguards not working as claimed
- **Regression Detection**: Cross-domain impacts discovered during validation
- **Quality Decline**: Baseline appears worse despite elimination claims

## Cross-Domain Validation Requirements

### Related Quality Domains to Check:
- **[RELATED_DOMAIN_1]**: [SPECIFIC_REGRESSION_RISKS] to validate
- **[RELATED_DOMAIN_2]**: [INTEGRATION_POINTS] requiring testing
- **Pattern Consistency**: [DOMAIN_RULES] compliance across changes

### Prevention Measure Validation:
- **Safeguard Functionality**: [PREVENTION_MECHANISMS] working correctly
- **Integration Testing**: [CROSS_COMPONENT_VALIDATION] requirements
- **Future-Proofing**: [RECURRENCE_PREVENTION] effectiveness assessment
