# Sprint Session Report Archive Process

## Purpose
Systematic capture of practitioner perspective from Codex CLI execution of Process v3.3 sprints for continuous process improvement and knowledge retention.

## Standard Process

### 1. Session Report Request
At sprint closure, request comprehensive session report from Codex CLI covering:
- Process framework effectiveness (3-role execution)
- Technical challenges and solutions
- Documentation quality assessment
- Tool integration experiences
- Recommendations for framework evolution

### 2. Archive Structure
Each sprint archive includes:
```
sprint-management/archive/{domain-sprint-date}/
├── prompt-archive.md              # All prompts used
├── session-report-codex.md        # Practitioner perspective
├── scrum-master-assessment.md     # Process effectiveness analysis
└── lessons-learned.md             # Combined insights for future sprints
```

### 3. Knowledge Integration
Session reports inform:
- Process v3.3 framework evolution
- Review-Prompt-Lib domain improvements  
- Tool integration enhancements
- Training and onboarding materials

## Role Clarity
- **Codex CLI**: Primary worker executing systematic quality improvement
- **Claude**: Scrum master managing process framework and sprint coordination
- **Session Reports**: Bridge between execution experience and process evolution

## Continuous Improvement
Archive analysis enables:
- Pattern identification across multiple sprints
- Process pain point elimination
- Framework effectiveness measurement
- Systematic approach refinement

---
**Implementation**: Standard for all Process v3.3 sprints
**Review Frequency**: After every 3-5 sprint completions
**Archive Retention**: Permanent for process evolution reference
