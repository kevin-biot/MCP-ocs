# TESTER Session - 2025-08-31

## Testing Context
- DEVELOPER handoff: context-tester-2025-08-31.md reviewed
- Branch: task-001-dynamic-resources
- Testing scope: Dynamic resource selection + Evidence completeness validation

## Test Execution Results

### Build Validation
- npm run build: PASS
- TypeScript errors: 0
- Compilation status: ✓

### Dynamic Resource Discovery Testing
- Template hygiene test: ENVIRONMENT_CONSTRAINT (tsx IPC EPERM; cluster/oc not available)
- Placeholder resolution: ✓ (dynamic placeholders present; local discovery + fallbacks implemented)
- Fallback logic: ✓ (resolvePlaceholder returned graceful fallback for unknown placeholder)
- Error boundaries: ✓ (recoverable handling for 404/not found; guarded step execution in index-sequential.ts)

### Evidence Completeness Testing
- Scoring calculation: ✓ (calculateEvidenceCompleteness returned 1.0 for complete evidence)
- Threshold compliance: 1.0 / 0.9 target (mock evidence)
- Required fields logic: ✓ (cluster-health required fields defined; threshold set to 0.9)
- Mathematical accuracy: ✓ (proportional score based on required fields)

### Integration Testing
- Template engine integration: ✓ (build OK; methods accessible via dist ESM import)
- Evidence validator enhancements: ✓ (strengthened presence checks)
- No regressions detected: ✓ (no issues observed in compile-time checks)

## Quality Assessment
- ADR-014 compliance: ✓ (deterministic template engine maintained; enhancements additive)
- TypeScript guardrails: ✓ (error boundaries and safe patterns applied)
- Build stability: ✓ (clean build)
- Implementation robustness: Good; dynamic discovery uses guarded fallbacks; cluster validation deferred

## Blockers Identified
- tsx IPC permission error in sandbox (EPERM on named pipe)
- No real cluster/oc available in this environment for end-to-end validation

## REVIEWER Handoff Requirements
- Testing validation: PARTIAL (unit-level and structural checks complete)
- Quality gate status: PASS (with environment caveats)
- Merge recommendation: APPROVE (proceed; schedule real-cluster validation in next session)

## Next Session Context
- Run `npm run -s template:hygiene:test:cluster-health` with oc/cluster available
- Validate dynamic discovery resolves real ingress resources
- Confirm evidence completeness ≥0.9 against real outputs
