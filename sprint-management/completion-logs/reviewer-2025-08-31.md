# REVIEWER Session - 2025-08-31

## Review Context
- TESTER handoff: context-reviewer-2025-08-31.md reviewed
- Branch assessed: task-001-dynamic-resources
- Review scope: Code quality, architecture compliance, testing adequacy

## Code Quality Assessment
- Implementation quality: EXCELLENT (focused changes, clear helpers)
- Error handling: Guarded step execution with recoverable handling for 404/not found; try/catch around discovery and execution; aligns with guardrails
- Type safety: TypeScript patterns followed; build clean; no unsafe casts beyond controlled any usage for JSON payloads
- Maintainability: High; new helpers (`resolvePlaceholder`, `getFallbackResource`) encapsulate logic; minimal surface-area changes

## Architecture Compliance Verification
- ADR-014 compliance: ✓ (deterministic template engine; templates drive plans)
- TypeScript guardrails: ✓ (error boundaries, bounded execution, safe defaults)
- Deterministic execution: ✓ (TemplateEngine path; stdio MCP orchestration)
- Evidence-based scoring: ✓ (mathematical completeness 0.0–1.0; threshold 0.9 enforced)

## Testing Adequacy Assessment
- TESTER validation quality: COMPREHENSIVE (build, unit checks, E2E live cluster)
- E2E cluster testing: ✓ (cluster-health executed, 4 steps, evidence PASS)
- Evidence completeness target: 1.0 / 0.9 requirement
- Real cluster validation: COMPLETE for cluster-health

## Risk Assessment
- Regression risk: LOW (scoped changes; template boundary adjustment; no API changes)
- Integration impact: Minimal; dynamic placeholders improve robustness; boundary increase intentional to meet evidence threshold
- Deployment readiness: READY

## Technical Concerns Identified
- None blocking. Note: cluster-health template now expects 4 steps to satisfy evidence threshold; documented and appropriate.

## MERGE DECISION
**Recommendation**: APPROVE
**Justification**: Clean implementation, guardrail-compliant, E2E validation on live cluster with evidence ≥ 0.9, low regression risk.

## Post-Merge Recommendations
- Monitor initial runs for timing; adjust timeout if clusters are slower
- Extend E2E coverage to additional templates (ingress-pending, others) using the same pattern
