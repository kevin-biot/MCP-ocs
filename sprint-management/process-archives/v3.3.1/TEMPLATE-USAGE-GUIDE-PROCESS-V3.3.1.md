# Template Usage Guide - Process v3.3.1
**Sprint Closure Template System**  
**Version**: 3.3.1  
**Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: ACTIVE - Mandatory for all Process v3.3 sprint closures  

## Flight Operations Analogy: Pilot & Co-Pilot Sprint Execution

### **"Pre-Flight Check" - Sprint Initialization**
Just as pilots complete systematic pre-flight checks before takeoff, Process v3.3.1 requires systematic template preparation before sprint execution.

**PILOT (Scrum Master) Responsibilities**:
- ✅ Verify all 11 template artifacts are ready for completion
- ✅ Confirm D-009 gold standard archive is accessible for reference
- ✅ Validate sprint-management framework synchronization across branches
- ✅ Establish evidence collection protocols (Review-Prompt-Lib if applicable)

**CO-PILOT (Development Team) Responsibilities**:
- ✅ Understand template completion expectations for their role phases
- ✅ Confirm access to execution log templates and completion criteria
- ✅ Verify artifact handoff procedures between DEVELOPER → TESTER → REVIEWER phases
- ✅ Acknowledge systematic evidence documentation requirements

### **"Takeoff Clearance" - Daily Sprint Standup Integration**

**DAILY STANDUP TEMPLATE CHECKPOINTS**:
```
Sprint Day N Standup:
├── Execution Progress: What artifacts are being populated today?
├── Template Status: Which completion documents need attention?
├── Evidence Collection: What systematic findings or decisions emerged?
├── Handoff Readiness: Are any role transitions happening today?
└── Landing Preparation: What closure artifacts can be started?
```

**PILOT MONITORING (Scrum Master Daily)**:
- **Template Discipline**: Ensure systematic documentation during execution, not just at closure
- **Quality Gates**: Verify evidence chains and decision rationale are being captured
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify template completion risks before they impact closure
- **Process Adherence**: Maintain Process v3.3 multi-role validation standards

└── Closure: Verify template readiness for final sprint synthesis
```

### **Role-Based Template Responsibilities**

**DEVELOPER Phase**:
- **Primary**: execution-log-developer.md, completion-developer-handoff.md
- **Contributing**: Evidence for quality assessment, technical metrics, key decisions

**TESTER Phase**:
- **Primary**: execution-log-tester.md, completion-tester-verification.md
- **Contributing**: Quality validation evidence, technical metrics, outstanding work identification

**REVIEWER Phase**:
- **Primary**: execution-log-reviewer.md, completion-final-closure.md
- **Contributing**: Framework assessment, strategic analysis, organizational learning

**SCRUM MASTER (All Phases)**:
- **Primary**: All analytical artifacts (04-09), sprint-retrospective.md synthesis
- **Monitoring**: Template quality, evidence collection, strategic intelligence capture

### **Template Creation Workflow**

**Phase 1: During Sprint Execution**
- Populate execution logs and completion artifacts in real-time
- Capture evidence and decisions as they occur
- Maintain systematic documentation discipline

**Phase 2: Sprint Closure (Day 1)**
- Complete analytical artifacts (04-09) using execution evidence
- Ensure D-009 quality parity and cross-reference integration
- Validate evidence chains and strategic intelligence

**Phase 3: Strategic Synthesis (Day 2)**

- **Quality Drift**: Ensure templates maintain D-009 standards without becoming bureaucratic
- **Stakeholder Utility**: Continuously validate PM and organizational value of comprehensive documentation

### **Iteration Feedback Loop**
Each sprint using templates provides feedback for:
- **Template Efficiency**: What's hard, missing, or excessive in template requirements
- **Process Integration**: How well templates integrate with daily development workflow
- **Strategic Value**: Actual utility of comprehensive documentation for decision-making
- **Organizational Learning**: Effectiveness of knowledge capture and pattern recognition

### **Success Metrics**
