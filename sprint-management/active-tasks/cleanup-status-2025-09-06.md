# Active Tasks Status Review - 2025-09-06

## Current Active Tasks Audit

### Completed and Needs Archival
- **d-009-date-time-safety-execution-prompt.md** → MOVED to D-009 archive ✅

### Historical Artifacts Requiring Review
- **codex-cli-developer-prompt.md** - Generic prompt, may need templates/ relocation
- **d-002-epic-004-architecture-validation.md** - Should be in D-002 archive if completed
- **d-005-d-006-quality-foundation-sprint.md** - Should be in D-005/D-006 archive if completed

## Cleanup Actions Required

### Immediate Cleanup
1. Move historical artifacts to appropriate archives
2. Clear active-tasks of completed work
3. Maintain only truly active/current work

### Active Tasks Directory Purpose
Should contain ONLY:
- Current sprint work in progress
- Immediate next sprint preparation
- Templates for active use

## Proposed Active Tasks Structure
```
sprint-management/active-tasks/
├── current-sprint-{domain}.md      # Only if sprint actively running
├── next-sprint-preparation.md      # Planning for immediate next sprint
└── daily-standup-context.md        # Current focus and blockers
```

All historical work should be archived systematically.
