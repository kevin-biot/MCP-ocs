markdown# TESTER Role Context - 2025-08-31
**Generated by**: DEVELOPER session
**Tasks Implemented**: TASK-001 (Dynamic Resource Selection), TASK-002 (Evidence Completeness)
**Branch**: task-001-dynamic-resources
**Testing Focus**: Validate JSON template enhancements and TemplateEngine improvements

## TESTING STRATEGY DESIGNED BY DEVELOPER

### PRIMARY TESTING OBJECTIVES
1. **Dynamic Resource Discovery Validation**
   - Test placeholder resolution with real cluster resources
   - Verify graceful fallback when zero resources found
   - Validate error boundary handling for resource discovery failures

2. **Evidence Completeness Scoring Validation**
   - Test scoring achieves ≥0.9 target across template types
   - Verify missing field reporting accuracy
   - Validate score integration in template execution output

### SPECIFIC TEST SCENARIOS

#### Test Scenario 1: Dynamic Resource Discovery
**Command**: `npm run -s template:hygiene:test:cluster-health`
**Expected Behavior**:
- cluster-health.json uses dynamic placeholders (no hardcoded resources)
- Template discovers actual ingress controller resources
- Graceful fallback when resources not found
- Error boundaries catch and handle discovery failures

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] No hardcoded resource names in execution
- [ ] Real cluster resources discovered and used
- [ ] Zero-resource scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] 404 errors produce recoverable error messages

#### Test Scenario 2: Evidence Completeness Scoring
**Command**: Run cluster-health template and examine evidence output
**Expected Behavior**:
- Evidence completeness score calculated mathematically
- Score ≥0.9 achieved for cluster-health template
- Missing field reporting clear and actionable
- Score included in template execution results

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Completeness score between 0.0-1.0
- [ ] Score ≥0.9 achieved with real cluster data
- [ ] Missing fields reported for debugging
- [ ] Score properly integrated in template output

#### Test Scenario 3: Error Boundary Validation
**Test Method**: Simulate error conditions
**Expected Behavior**:
- 404 errors handled gracefully
- Template execution continues after recoverable errors
- Clear error messages for debugging
- No unhandled exceptions

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] 404 errors don't crash template execution
- [ ] Recoverable errors logged but execution continues
- [ ] Error messages provide meaningful debugging info
- [ ] Template completes with partial evidence when appropriate

### BUILD AND INTEGRATION TESTING

#### Build Validation
**Command**: `npm run build`
**Expected**: Clean build with no TypeScript errors
**Validation**: [ ] Build passes without compilation errors

#### Integration Testing
**Commands**: 
- Test enhanced TemplateEngine with multiple templates
- Verify evidence-validator.ts enhancements
- Test index-sequential.ts placeholder resolution

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] All enhanced files integrate properly
- [ ] No regression in existing template functionality
- [ ] Evidence validation stronger than before

### FILES MODIFIED BY DEVELOPER (For Testing Focus)
1. `src/index-sequential.ts` - Enhanced placeholder resolution
2. `src/lib/templates/template-engine.ts` - Added resource discovery and evidence scoring
3. `src/lib/templates/evidence-validator.ts` - Strengthened validation
4. `src/lib/templates/templates/cluster-health.json` - Dynamic placeholders

### GUARDRAILS COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION
**TESTER must verify**:
- [ ] Direct tool registration approach maintained
- [ ] Error boundaries implemented consistently  
- [ ] Type safety preserved throughout changes
- [ ] Build stability maintained

### SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR TESTER SESSION
- All test scenarios pass validation criteria
- Evidence completeness scores ≥0.9 in real cluster testing
- No regressions in existing template functionality
- Error handling robust against cluster variability

### HANDOFF TO REVIEWER
After TESTER validation, create REVIEWER context with:
- Testing results summary
- Quality assessment findings
- Architecture compliance verification
- Merge recommendation

## TESTER EXECUTION GUIDANCE
1. Read this context file first
2. Execute test scenarios systematically
3. Document results in completion-logs/tester-2025-08-31.md
4. Create REVIEWER context if all tests pass
5. Report blockers if critical tests fail
