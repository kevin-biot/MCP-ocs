# REVIEWER Role Context - 2025-08-31
**Generated by**: TESTER session (with DEVELOPER handoff)
**Branch**: task-001-dynamic-resources
**Scope**: TASK-001 Dynamic Resource Selection, TASK-002 Evidence Completeness

## Summary
- Build: PASS (`npm run build`)
- E2E (real cluster): PASS for cluster-health template using KUBECONFIG
- Evidence completeness: 1.00/1.0 (threshold 0.9) on live cluster
- Dynamic placeholders: Resolved to actual resources (ingress namespaces/controllers)
- Error boundaries: Present; no crashes; recoverable handling in place

## What Was Verified
- Template Engine executes cluster-health deterministically via stdio MCP server
- Dynamic placeholders in `cluster-health.json`:
  - `<ingressNamespace>` → `openshift-ingress`
  - `<ingressControllerNamespace>` → `openshift-ingress-operator`
  - `<ingressControllerName>` → `default`
- Evidence contract required fields satisfied from real outputs:
  - nodesSummary, podSummary, controlPlaneAlerts, fanoutHint
- IngressController describe contained DeploymentRollingOut/NotAvailable signals

## Key Artifacts
- E2E script: `scripts/e2e/e2e-template-cluster-health.mjs` (added)
- Template update: `src/lib/templates/templates/cluster-health.json` (boundaries set to `{ maxSteps: 4, timeoutMs: 20000 }`)
- Server logs: `logs/mcp-server-sequential.log`
- Summaries: `logs/runs/*cluster-health*.summary.json` (if generated during manual runs)

## Architecture Compliance (ADR-014)
- Deterministic Template Engine path maintained; no architectural disruption
- Placeholder resolution and resource discovery follow guardrails with fallbacks
- Error boundaries applied around tool execution
- TypeScript security guardrails: respected (try/catch, bounded execution)

## Regression/Risk Assessment
- No regressions observed in build or E2E cluster-health run
- Boundary change to `cluster-health.json` increases maxSteps (3→4) to satisfy evidence threshold; contained change, aligned with template intent

## Merge Recommendation
- Quality Gate: PASS
- Real-Cluster Validation: PASS (evidence ≥ 0.9)
- Recommendation: APPROVE merge of `task-001-dynamic-resources` into `feature/deterministic-template-engine`

## Re-run Instructions (Reviewer)
1. Ensure cluster auth: `export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig && oc whoami`
2. Run E2E: `node scripts/e2e/e2e-template-cluster-health.mjs`
3. Review output for `evidence.pass: true` and completeness ≥ 0.9
