## Archive Structure
Created: September 3, 2025
Sprint: D-005 (Async Correctness) + D-006 (Error Taxonomy) Quality Foundation
Process: v3.2 Enhanced Framework with Time Loss Prevention

## Archived Documentation

### Sprint Summary
- `d-005-d-006-final-sprint-summary-v3.2.md` - Complete sprint overview and results

### Process Validation
- `d-005-d-006-process-calibration-v3.2.md` - Detailed timing and resource data
- Process v3.2 framework validated with time loss prevention enhancements

### Implementation Evidence
- Core async correctness and error taxonomy implementations
- Unit test validation using Node.js native test runner
- Complete three-phase execution (DEVELOPER → TESTER → REVIEWER)

### Strategic Impact
- Quality foundation established: 21% → 33% domain completion
- System reliability significantly improved
- Professional error handling patterns implemented

## Key Learnings Captured
- Extended sprint patterns and time management
- ESM project testing strategies (Node.js native optimal)
- Time loss prevention framework development and validation
- Alternative approach assessment methodologies

## Next Sprint Planning Guidance
- Use calibration data for improved time estimation
- Apply time loss prevention framework for optional enhancements
- Continue Node.js native testing approach or evaluate Vitest migration
- Enhanced Process v3.2 ready for systematic daily operations
