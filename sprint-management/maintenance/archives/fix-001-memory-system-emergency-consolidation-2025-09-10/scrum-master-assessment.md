# Scrum Master Assessment — FIX-001

Framework: Process v3.3.2

Assessment:
- Closure standard: Using v3.3.2 archive structure and artifacts
- Evidence quality: Sufficient to demonstrate isolation + safety fallbacks
- Risk posture: Lowered via JSON-only path and isolation prefix
- Process evolution: Daily template enforcement added to prevent drift

Recommendations:
- Extend Vector Safe Test coverage to more operations
- Formalize metrics baseline in 08-technical-metrics-data.json
