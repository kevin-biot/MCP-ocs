# ADR Impact Analysis — FIX-001

Primary ADRs impacted:
- ADR-003 (memory patterns): isolation + fallback patterns strengthened
- ADR-014 (deterministic template engine): consistent, JSON-safe evidence paths

Secondary benefits:
- ADR-006 (modular tool architecture): unified memory interfaces clarified
- ADR-010 (systemic intelligence): safer baseline for analytical tooling
- ADR-024 (performance): bounded operations and measured improvements
