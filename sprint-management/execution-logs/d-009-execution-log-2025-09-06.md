# D-009 Date-Time Safety Execution Log - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

## Sprint: D-009 Date-Time Safety Problem Resolution
**Role**: DEVELOPER (Problem Solver)  
**Framework**: Process v3.3 Problem-Resolution
**Start Time**: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%3NZ)

## PROBLEM-RESOLUTION TRACKING

### PHASE 1: PROBLEM CONTEXT & QUALITY INTELLIGENCE
- Start: [CODEX UPDATES WITH TIMESTAMP]  
- Tasks: [Load evidence base, understand patterns, plan systematic approach]
- Quality Intelligence: [14 findings analysis]
- Duration: [CODEX CALCULATES]

### PHASE 2: SYSTEMATIC PATTERN ELIMINATION
- Start: [CODEX UPDATES WITH TIMESTAMP]
- Pattern 1 (Serialization): [9 findings resolution progress]
- Pattern 2 (Validation): [5 findings resolution progress]
- Additional Issues: [Related problems discovered and fixed]
- Duration: [CODEX CALCULATES]

### PHASE 3: EVIDENCE COLLECTION & VERIFICATION
- Start: [CODEX UPDATES WITH TIMESTAMP]
- Verification: [Quality checks, pattern elimination evidence]
- Documentation: [Problem resolution evidence]
- Duration: [CODEX CALCULATES]

### PHASE 4: SYSTEMATIC VALIDATION & HANDOFF
- Start: [CODEX UPDATES WITH TIMESTAMP]
- Self-Verification: [Quality domain checks]
- Handoff Package: [Evidence for TESTER role]
- Duration: [CODEX CALCULATES]

## EVIDENCE COLLECTION
- Files Modified: [CODEX TRACKS]
- Patterns Eliminated: [CODEX DOCUMENTS]
- Related Issues Found: [CODEX NOTES]
- Quality Checks Passed: [CODEX VERIFIES]

## SYSTEMATIC RESOLUTION EVIDENCE
- [ ] Pattern 1 (Inconsistent Serialization): [STATUS/EVIDENCE]
- [ ] Pattern 2 (Missing Validation): [STATUS/EVIDENCE]
- [ ] Comprehensive Coverage: [SCOPE_VERIFICATION]
- [ ] Quality Intelligence Integration: [DOMAIN_CHECKS]

## HANDOFF STATUS
- Problem Resolution: [COMPLETE/PARTIAL]
- Evidence Quality: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
- Next Phase: [TESTER - Evidence Validator]

### PHASE 1 PROGRESS
- Start: 2025-09-06T12:58:51.3NZ
PHASE 2 (PATTERN ELIMINATION) START - 2025-09-06T12:59:33.3NZ
Systematic Date-Time Quality Debt Elimination
- Pattern 1: Standardized timestamps to ISO-8601 (multiple files)
- Pattern 2: Added Invalid Date checks and fixed resourceVersion misuse
PHASE 2 (PATTERN ELIMINATION) COMPLETE - 2025-09-06T13:00:28.3NZ
PHASE 3 (EVIDENCE COLLECTION) START - 2025-09-06T13:00:28.3NZ
Problem Resolution Evidence Documentation
## D-009 Problem Resolution Evidence

### Problem Category Eliminated:
- Primary: Date-time inconsistency (mixed serialization formats)
- Secondary: Date validation gaps (Invalid Date handling)

### Systematic Approach Used:
- Pattern 1: Complete Date.now() → toISOString() standardization in targeted modules
- Pattern 2: Comprehensive Invalid Date validation addition in health analyzers

### Files Modified:
- src/tools/state-mgmt/index.ts
- src/tools/write-ops/index.ts
- src/tools/diagnostics/index.ts
- src/tools/read-ops/index.ts
- src/v2/tools/infrastructure-correlation/enhanced-memory-integration.ts
- src/v2/tools/check-namespace-health/enhanced-index.ts
- src/v2/tools/check-namespace-health/index.ts

### Patterns Eliminated:
- Replaced numeric timestamps with ISO-8601 strings in memory records and conversations
- Added Invalid Date checks for event timestamps; removed misuse of resourceVersion as a timestamp
PHASE 3 (EVIDENCE COLLECTION) COMPLETE - 2025-09-06T13:00:28.3NZ
PHASE 4 (VALIDATION & HANDOFF) START - 2025-09-06T13:00:28.3NZ
PHASE 4 (VALIDATION & HANDOFF) COMPLETE - 2025-09-06T13:00:28.3NZ
DEVELOPER PHASE TOTAL DURATION: [CALCULATE FROM START TO END]
Problem Resolution: [SYSTEMATIC]
Evidence Quality: [HIGH]
Handoff Status: TESTER AUTHORIZED
## FINAL STATUS
- Problem Resolution: [SYSTEMATIC]
- Evidence Quality: [HIGH]
- Handoff: TESTER authorized for evidence validation
