# Template Usage Guide - Process v3.3.2
**Sprint Closure Template System**  
**Version**: 3.3.2  
**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: ACTIVE - Mandatory for all Process v3.3.2 sprint closures  
**Evolution**: Process v3.3.1 + CODEX Documentation Standards

## Flight Operations Analogy: Pilot & Co-Pilot Sprint Execution

### **"Pre-Flight Check" - Sprint Initialization**
Just as pilots complete systematic pre-flight checks before takeoff, Process v3.3.2 requires systematic template preparation before sprint execution.

**PILOT (Scrum Master) Responsibilities**:
- ✅ Verify all 17 template artifacts are ready for completion (including CODEX execution log)
- ✅ Confirm D-009 gold standard archive is accessible for reference
- ✅ Validate sprint-management framework synchronization across branches
- ✅ Establish evidence collection protocols (Review-Prompt-Lib if applicable)

**CO-PILOT (Development Team) Responsibilities**:
- ✅ Understand template completion expectations for their role phases
- ✅ Confirm access to execution log templates and completion criteria
- ✅ Prepare for AI-executor documentation requirements (CODEX sessions)

## PROCESS v3.3.2 INTEGRATION WITH SPRINT MANAGEMENT

### Enhanced AI-Human Collaboration Framework
All sprints following Process v3.3.2 must document:
- **AI Primary Execution**: Complete CODEX methodology documentation
- **Human Strategic Oversight**: Decision authority and scope management
- **Cross-Session Continuity**: How AI maintains context across interruptions
- **Performance Optimization**: AI-driven systematic improvement methodology

### Quality Intelligence Integration (Same as v3.3.1)
Process v3.3.2 integrates with `/review-prompt-lib/domains/` for:
- Historical finding tracking
- Domain-specific review criteria  
- Quality baseline measurement
- Cross-domain impact assessment

### Framework Evolution Tracking
Process v3.3.2 includes systematic documentation of:
- Why v3.3.1 → v3.3.2 evolution occurred (CODEX gap closure)
- What enhancements were added (AI executor documentation)
- How backward compatibility is maintained (all v3.3.1 artifacts still required)
- Future evolution pathway (toward v3.4 with enhanced AI integration)

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR PROCESS v3.3.2

### Must-Have (P0)
- [ ] All 17 mandatory artifacts created with D-009 quality parity
- [ ] Complete CODEX execution documentation with reproducible methodology
- [ ] AI-human collaboration patterns clearly documented
- [ ] Strategic intelligence accessible to PM without technical deep-dive
- [ ] Archive structure compliant with enhanced v3.3.2 standards

### Selective Enrichment Pilot (Optional, v3.3.3 Add‑On)
- After deterministic closure (17 artifacts validated), an optional enrichment step may be triggered by the Operator.
- Phase‑1 targets: 09‑outstanding‑work‑analysis.md, sprint‑retrospective.md (Context Abstract), 07‑key‑decisions‑log.md.
- Edits must be confined to <!-- ENRICHMENT: begin/end --> zones and remain evidence‑anchored (artifacts/logs/ADRs/commits/code paths).
- See `sprint-management/process/ENRICHMENT-PILOT-V3.3.3.md` for roles, steps, guardrails, and acceptance criteria.

### Should-Have (P1)  
- [ ] Cross-session AI continuity methodology proven effective
- [ ] Performance optimization patterns documented for replication
- [ ] Organizational learning captured for AI-driven sprint methodology
- [ ] Framework evolution intelligence for future process development

---

## BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

**Process v3.3.2 is fully backward compatible with v3.3.1**:
- All 16 v3.3.1 artifacts remain required
- Same archive structure with additions
- Same quality standards and evidence requirements
- Enhanced with AI documentation, not replaced

**Migration Path**:
- Existing v3.3.1 sprints remain valid
- New sprints use v3.3.2 with CODEX documentation
- No retroactive updates required for archived sprints

---

**PROCESS V3.3.2 READY**: Complete framework for AI-human collaborative sprint execution  
**EVOLUTION COMPLETE**: v3.3.1 + CODEX documentation gap closure  
**ORGANIZATIONAL ADVANCEMENT**: Systematic AI executor methodology established  
**QUALITY MAINTAINED**: D-009 parity standard preserved with enhanced AI integration
### Optional Context Layer (Manual, Non-Blocking)
- After the required artifacts are complete, a human may trigger an evidence-anchored verbose context report for richer historical memory.
- Store as `process-artifacts/verbose-context.md` and optionally `process-artifacts/context-index.json` (sprintId, start/end, key decisions, ADR impacts, risks, follow-ups).
- This addendum must not replace or delay the 17 required artifacts.
