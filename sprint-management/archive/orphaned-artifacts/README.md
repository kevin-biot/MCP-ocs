# Orphaned Artifacts Archive

This directory contains process artifacts that were left behind during process evolution or sprint transitions.

## Purpose
- Preserve historical context without cluttering active workspace  
- Maintain audit trail for process improvement analysis
- Store files that missed proper archiving during sprint completion

## Files

### tasks-current-legacy-2025-08-28-to-30.md
**Original**: `tasks-current.md` (root of sprint-management)  
**Issue**: Left behind when Process v3.1 → v3.2 evolution occurred  
**Content**: Template Hygiene Sweep sprint (Aug 28-30, 2025)  
**Status**: Completed but not properly archived at sprint end  
**Archived**: September 2, 2025  
**Reason**: Process compliance cleanup - tasks-current.md should be ephemeral and archived at sprint completion

### linkedin-partnership-outreach-business-doc.md  
**Original**: `linkedin-partnership-outreach.md` (root of sprint-management)
**Issue**: Business document mixed with sprint process files
**Content**: Partnership outreach templates and strategy
**Status**: Business planning document, not sprint process
**Archived**: September 2, 2025  
**Reason**: Wrong directory - business docs don't belong in sprint-management

### implementation-complete-workflow-enhancement.md
**Original**: `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` (root of sprint-management)
**Issue**: Completion log left in active workspace  
**Content**: DEVELOPER → TESTER workflow enhancement completion status
**Status**: Historical completion record
**Archived**: September 2, 2025
**Reason**: Completion logs should be archived after documentation

### next-sprint-ready-outdated-planning.md
**Original**: `next-sprint-ready.md` (root of sprint-management) 
**Issue**: Outdated sprint planning document
**Content**: Planning for D-002 EPIC-004 (now completed)
**Status**: Superseded by actual sprint completion
**Archived**: September 2, 2025
**Reason**: Planning document outdated by sprint completion

### typescript-security-guardrails-memory-aug30.md
**Original**: `TYPESCRIPT-SECURITY-GUARDRAILS-MEMORY.md` (root of sprint-management)
**Issue**: Implementation memory document in active workspace
**Content**: Security domains and task backlog (August 30, 2025)
**Status**: Historical implementation record  
**Archived**: September 2, 2025
**Reason**: Memory/documentation artifacts should be archived, not in active process space

## Guidelines for Future Orphaned Artifacts
- Rename with descriptive suffix indicating original context
- Add entry to this README explaining why orphaned  
- Preserve file modification dates when possible
- Include date archived and reason for orphaning
