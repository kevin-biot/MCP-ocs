# Integration Update Required - Cross-Reference Unified Strategic Roadmap

## Files Needing Updates

### 1. `sprint-management/features/feature-backlog.md`
**Missing**: Reference to unified strategic roadmap and phase integration
**Add at top after Overview**:
```markdown
**🎯 STRATEGIC INTEGRATION**: This feature backlog implements the execution plan for [Unified Strategic Roadmap](../../docs/implementation/UNIFIED_STRATEGIC_ROADMAP.md)
- **Phase 0**: RFR remediation (Critical architectural debt resolution)  
- **Phase 1**: OpenShift MCP Delivery (Core platform features F-001, F-002, F-003, F-004)
- **Phase 2**: DOP Architecture Enhancement (Advanced features F-006, F-007, F-008, F-009)
- **Phase 3**: Framework extraction (Multi-domain evolution)
```

### 2. `sprint-management/backlog/backlog-overview.md`
**Missing**: Strategic roadmap context and phase alignment
**Add after Overview**:
```markdown
**📋 STRATEGIC CONTEXT**: Quality backlog supports [Unified Strategic Roadmap](../../docs/implementation/UNIFIED_STRATEGIC_ROADMAP.md) execution:
- **Phase 0 Support**: RFR remediation domains ensure framework viability
- **Phase 1 Foundation**: Quality domains (D-001 to D-015) enable OpenShift MCP delivery  
- **Phase 2 Enhancement**: Quality infrastructure supports DOP compliance requirements
- **Cross-Integration**: Quality and feature backlogs coordinate through shared strategic phases
```

## Implementation
These updates cross-link the strategic roadmap with tactical execution planning, ensuring coherent execution across all planning documents.
