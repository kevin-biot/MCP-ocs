- [ ] First 5 Middle East prospect contacts
- [ ] Initial PoC proposal development

## 🎯 Key Decisions for Next Session

### Technical Architecture
1. **Operator Complexity**: Full CRD vs simple deployment?
2. **Memory Optimization**: Target memory footprint for small ops teams?
3. **Multi-LLM Protocol**: How to coordinate across Claude sessions?
4. **Red Hat Integration**: Minimum requirements for Ready certification?

### Business Strategy  
1. **Open Source Scope**: What features in OSS vs commercial?
2. **Partnership Approach**: Direct Red Hat vs ecosystem partners?
3. **Pricing Validation**: Test $95K package with prospects?
4. **Market Entry**: Start with Middle East or broader?

### Implementation Priority
1. **V1.1 Feature Set**: War room intelligence vs simple diagnostics?
2. **Certification Timeline**: Red Hat Ready vs speed to market?
3. **Customer Development**: Build product vs customer discovery?
4. **Team Scaling**: Solo development vs team expansion?
