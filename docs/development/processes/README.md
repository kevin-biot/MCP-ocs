## 📚 Process Documentation

### **Core Framework**
- **[HUMAN-AI-DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS.md](./HUMAN-AI-DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS.md)** - Complete v2.0 framework with daily workflows, multi-LLM coordination, and universal deployment design
- **[DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS-STATUS.md](./DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS-STATUS.md)** - Implementation status, metrics, and validation results

### **Related Documentation**
- **[../implementation/DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md](../implementation/DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md)** - Original v1.0 framework (foundational document)
- **[../architecture/ADR-OVERVIEW.md](../architecture/ADR-OVERVIEW.md)** - Complete ADR catalog and paradigm analysis

## 🎯 Quick Start

### **For New Team Members**
1. Read **HUMAN-AI-DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS.md** for complete framework understanding
2. Review **DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS-STATUS.md** for current implementation status
3. Check **ADR-OVERVIEW.md** for architectural context and decision history
4. Follow daily workflow structure for immediate productivity

### **For Process Improvement**
1. Review current metrics in **DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS-STATUS.md**
2. Identify improvement opportunities based on usage patterns
3. Update framework documentation with refinements
4. Test changes with pilot projects before broad adoption

## 🔄 Framework Evolution

### **Validated Patterns**
- **Memory-Enhanced Context**: AI assistants as institutional knowledge engines
- **ADR-Driven Architecture**: Living documentation that evolves with implementation
- **Multi-LLM Coordination**: Specialized AI roles for different development phases
- **Human-Guided Execution**: Strategic decisions by humans, tactical execution by AI

### **Next Phase Priorities**
1. **Universal Framework Development**: Drop-in setup for any development team
2. **Cross-Project Validation**: Testing framework across different project types
3. **Tool Integration**: Progressive enhancement based on available capabilities
4. **Process Automation**: Reducing manual overhead while maintaining quality
