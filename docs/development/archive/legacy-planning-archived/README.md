# Legacy Planning Archive

## Archive Purpose
This directory contains the original legacy planning documents that were successfully mined for architectural vision and integrated into the current sprint-management structure on August 30, 2025.

## Integration Summary
**Gold Mining Results**: Successfully extracted and integrated comprehensive planning details into current feature backlog structure.

### **Integrated Content:**

#### **F-002 Operational Intelligence Enhanced**:
- **19 comprehensive diagnostic templates** with specific evidence thresholds
- **Infrastructure tools library** (oc_read_nodes_enhanced, oc_analyze_scheduling_failures, etc.)
- **Tier-based template organization** (Production Ready, Infrastructure Intelligence, Advanced Diagnostics)

#### **F-004 Template Quality Enhanced**:
- **32 comprehensive rubrics library** from deterministic implementation plan
- **Specific rubric categories**: Core (gated), Infrastructure (visual), Diagnostic, Memory, Workflow, Meta/Verification
- **Production quality standards** with evidence completeness ≥0.9 + rubrics coverage

#### **F-005 Tool Maturity System Created**:
- **CODEX Beta Strategy** fully integrated as new epic
- **8 validated production tools** with 75% success rate from comprehensive-diagnostic-67890 session
- **Tool maturity framework** (Production/Beta/Alpha/Development) with build-time filtering

#### **Success Criteria Integration**:
- **Operational Intelligence metrics**: ≥95% triage accuracy, <500ms zone detection
- **Cross-model validation standards**: ≥95% consistency, ≤20% performance variance
- **Quality gates**: Evidence completeness, safety validation, SLO impact prediction

## Value Preservation
**All architectural vision from legacy planning has been preserved and integrated into the current sprint-management framework. Nothing was lost in the transition.**

**Integration Date**: August 30, 2025  
**Status**: Complete - Legacy planning successfully archived and integrated  
**Next Phase**: Daily standup execution with enhanced feature scope
